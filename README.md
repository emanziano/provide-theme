Provides themes as classes created by JSS to React components.


## Installation

```
npm install react-redux-provide-theme --save
```


## Usage

> **Note:**  This will only work clientside at the moment.  Server rendering coming soon!

This provides React components with interchangeable themes and automatically namespaced classNames via the following `propTypes`:

- `setTheme (Object theme)` - at a minimum, the `theme` object should contain a `styles` object; each key within `theme.styles` will be automatically namespaced and added to your app's stylesheet (which is also automatically generated) by [`jss`](https://github.com/jsstyles/jss); you can then obtain the namespaced classNames via the reduced `classes` prop

Your components may also be provided the following reduced props:

- `theme` - contains the entire theme object; nice to have if your app depends on custom properties (e.g., icons, images, boolean values, etc.) within the current theme
- `classes` - the namespaced classNames automatically generated by [`jss`](https://github.com/jsstyles/jss); these classNames are derived from the `theme.styles` object

**Note:**  [`jss`](https://github.com/jsstyles/jss) is designed to be extensible via plugins.  As a convenience, the following plugins are used by default, mainly to allow your theme's styles to work similarly to React's inline styles:

- [`jss-extend`](https://github.com/jsstyles/jss-extend)
- [`jss-nested`](https://github.com/jsstyles/jss-nested)
- [`jss-camel-case`](https://github.com/jsstyles/jss-camel-case)
- [`jss-px`](https://github.com/jsstyles/jss-px)
- [`jss-vendor-prefixer`](https://github.com/jsstyles/jss-vendor-prefixer)
- [`jss-props-sort`](https://github.com/jsstyles/jss-props-sort)


## Example

See [`bloggur`](https://github.com/loggur/bloggur) and [`bloggur-theme-dark`](https://github.com/loggur/bloggur-theme-dark).  **Protip:**  You can include images with your theme's bundle!  It's also good practice to use vector formats (e.g., `svg` files) where possible.
